I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```
I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 2

The code bellow creates a data frame and generate a plot.
```{r plot_example, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# eval means, echo means the code, message means warnings or other messages, include means everything
library(tidyverse)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean=2, sd=4),
  y = 3 - 4.2 * x + rnorm(500)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x,y=y)) + geom_point()
```

The plot is great. It shows a linear relation as expected.


Here is a list:

* This is my first list item
* Lists need at least two items
  * sub item number 1
  * sub item number 2
* Third list item
