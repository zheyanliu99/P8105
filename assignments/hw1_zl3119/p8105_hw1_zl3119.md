# Problem 1

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce
coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor
variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.

## Create a DataFrame

Create a DataFrame comprised of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
# Generate a DataFrame with size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
rnorm_df = tibble(
  rnum = rnorm(10, sd = 1)
) 

final_df = rnorm_df %>% 
  # a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  mutate(if_positive = ifelse(rnum > 0, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  # a character vector of length 10
  mutate(animals = sample(c('cat', 'dog', 'lion', 'panda', 'elephant'),size = 10, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  # factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
  mutate(value_size = factor(ifelse(rnum > - 0.5, ifelse(rnum < 0.5, 'medium', 'big'), 'small'))) 
```

## Take the mean of each variable

``` r
mean(final_df$rnum)
```

    ## [1] 0.1353962

``` r
mean(final_df$if_positive)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(final_df$animals)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(final_df$animals): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(final_df$value_size)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(final_df$value_size): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

It only works for numerical and bool variables.

## Convert variables to number

Use “as.numeric” function to the logical, character, and factor
variables

    ## [1] "logical variable"

    ##  [1] 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

    ## [1] "character variable"

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

    ## [1] "factor variables"

    ##  [1] 3 1 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 1

logical variable will be transformed into 0 and 1. Character variable
will be forced to become NA. Also, factors will be transformed into
levels. And we can take the mean of levels as below.

``` r
mean(as.numeric(final_df$value_size))
```

    ## [1] 1.8
